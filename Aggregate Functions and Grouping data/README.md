### Description
Practical tasks for Aggregate Functions and Grouping data

#### Theory:
* Aggregate Functions: COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX, MIN
* Grouping data: GROUP BY, HAVING, GROUPING SETS
 
#### Practical tasks:
**Description:**

2. Available quantity
3. Product type
4. Price without VAT
5. Price with VAT
6. Is product in stock
7. Warehouse (can be an id, name of city, etc - it doesnt matter)

**Create scripts using aggregation functions and functions for grouping data:**

2. Get the average product price with VAT for all categories
3. Get the total amount of all available items in stock (use price with VAT and available qty.)
4. Find the most and least expensive item from the table
5. Find the most expensive item in each warehouse
